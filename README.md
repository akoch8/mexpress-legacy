MEXPRESS

### About

[MEXPRESS](http://mexpress.be) is a data visualization tool designed for the easy visualization of [TCGA](https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) expression, DNA methylation and clinical data, as well as the relationships between them. It has been published in BMC Genomics: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/16/636.

This repository contains the back and front-end code to of the original version of MEXPRESS ([https://mexpress.be/old/mexpress.php](https://mexpress.be/old/mexpress.php)). You can find the new version at [https://mexpress.be](https://mexpress.be).

This repo also includes the different scripts that are used to download and process the TCGA data that is needed for the tool to work.

### NOTICE

The TCGA data has recently been migrated to the [Genomic Data Commons website](https://gdc.cancer.gov/). This means that the scripts I wrote to download the data from the original TCGA repository **DO NOT WORK ANYMORE**. The new version of MEXPRESS pulls all its TCGA data from the public data hubs of the [Xena browser](https://xenabrowser.net).
